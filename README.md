### Wordle in Python(Graphics)
Made using turtle and tkinter libraries.  
Possible answers and valid word lists fetched from imported JSON files.

### Wordle in Python(text)
Basic code, no graphics involved. See character meanings [here](#character-meanings)  
Supports imported word list.

### Wordle in Java(text)
Same functionality as wordle in python(text). See character meanings [here](#character-meanings)  
Currently does not support imported JSON word list.

#### Bugs
- Extra letters not greyed out
- Blank tkinter root window pop up
- Text versions lack some necessary checks

#### Character meanings
**ðŸŸ© or \# = correct letter correct position**  
**ðŸŸ¨ or \* = correct letter wrong position**  
**â¬› or \- = letter not present**
